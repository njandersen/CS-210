# CS-210

#Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
  So the program I chose was a program that took in user input for interest rate, investment, monthly deposit and number of years then calculated the compound interest over those number of years. It took me a long time to finally get it to opperate the way I wanted. I ended up designing it several different ways before landing on the final product. 

#What did you do particularly well?
  I feel like the overall structure of the classes I did really well and keeping the main function fairly clean and straightforward. 

#Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
  Implementing the try/catch block of code is something I feel I should have spent more time fixing. Also why it will print one more line in the reports even though it exceeds the vector limits. 

#Did you find writing any piece of this code challenging, and how did you overcome this?
  Yes, figuring out how to get all the information that I stored in vectors to print all in one nice table. There was probably a more elegant, simple solution but I could not figure it out. 
  
#What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
  I feel like everything I have learned in this class is very usful and is things that I will use and see again in future classes. Particularly the use of vectors and points and linked lists. 
  
#How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  I kept it readable by maintaining best practices and keeping main as clean as I could. I also feel like the functions in the class files are very adaptable and could easily be used again.
